## 🚨 The Era of "Hyper-Reality"
We have entered an age where seeing is no longer believing.
* **Images:** Receipts and documents are forged with pixel-perfect precision.
* **Video:** Deepfakes manipulate public opinion and ruin reputations.
* **Trust:** Is eroding faster than ever.

**TruthLens** is not just a receipt checker. It is a **Multimodal Forensic Engine** built on **Google AI Studio**, designed to restore trust in the digital ecosystem. By leveraging the massive context window and reasoning capabilities of **Gemini 3 Pro**, we analyze the *physics* of media, not just the content.

## ✨ Core Features (Live Now)

### 1. 📸 Advanced Image Forensics
TruthLens looks past the pixels to find the flaws in the math.
* **The "Logic Lock":** Automatically validates document metadata (Dates, Transaction IDs) against real-world logic (Julian Dates, Calendar consistency).
* **Texture Physics:** Scans for the absence of natural sensor noise (ISO grain). If an image is "too smooth," it’s flagged.
* **Vector Hallucinations:** Detects "wobbly" lines and asymmetrical logos that generative models struggle to render perfectly.

### 2. 🎥 Video Deepfake Detection
Static analysis isn't enough. TruthLens analyzes **Temporal Consistency** across frames.
* **Glitch Detection:** Scans for micro-artifacts where a deepfake face "detaches" or morphs unnaturally during rapid movement.
* **Lighting Consistency:** Verifies if the lighting on the subject matches the environment across the entire timeline.
* **Lip-Sync Fidelity:** Checks for subtle desynchronization between audio phonemes and visual mouth shapes.

### 3. ⏳ Temporal Grounding (Anti-Hallucination)
AI models often live in a timeless void. We solved this.
* **Dynamic Anchoring:** We inject real-time `{{CURRENT_DATE}}` data into the system prompt.
* **Benefit:** Prevents the AI from hallucinating that valid 2025 dates are "in the future" or accepting expired documents as new.

## 🚀 Roadmap: The Next Frontier

### 🌐 Ubiquitous Access (Web + Chrome Extension)
In our upcoming production phase, we are moving beyond just a standalone website.
* **The Vision:** Verifying truth should be as easy as a right-click.
* **The Extension:** We are developing a **TruthLens Chrome Extension** that integrates directly into your browser. This will allow users to instantly scan images on social media (X, Instagram, WhatsApp Web) without needing to download and re-upload files to our web app.

### 🎙️ Audio Spectrum Analysis
**Why isn't it here yet?**
Audio deepfakes (Voice Cloning) require a fundamentally different approach than visual media. While video relies on pixel consistency, audio requires **Spectrogram Analysis** to detect synthetic frequency cut-offs and robotic breathing patterns.

**Status:**
We are training a specialized "Audio Pulse" module to detect these sub-perceptual artifacts. This feature will roll out in **Phase 2**, enabling full A/V verification.

## 🛠️ How It Works

**The Gemini 3 Pro Advantage:**
Traditional detectors use small, specific models. TruthLens uses Gemini's **Multimodal Reasoning**:
> *"Instead of just looking for a specific artifact, TruthLens 'reasons' through the video. It notices if a shadow doesn't move correctly with the head, or if a reflection in the eye is missing. It applies physics to pixels."*

**The "Vibe" Architecture:**
Designed with a "DeepMind-inspired" aesthetic—dark mode, glassmorphism, and iridescent gradients—to ensure the user experience is as futuristic as the technology behind it.

## 🤝 Contributing
**We cannot fight synthetic misinformation alone.**

TruthLens is an open mission. If you are a prompt engineer, a React developer, or a forensic researcher, I would appreciate your help.

* **Found a bug?** Open an Issue.
* **Have a new forensic rule?** Submit a Pull Request.
* **Want to improve the UI?** Feel free to contribute!

Check out our `CONTRIBUTING.md` (coming soon) or just fork the repo and start building. Let's verify the world, together.
